        We adopt a child-centric approach to education and recognize talent in our students. New, modern-day pedagogical concepts such as Design Thinking, Literacy and Numeracy Skills are part of the school’s curriculum. We stress on good values like compassion, empathy, kindness, solidarity and tolerance as much as we emphasize on intellect, wit, critical thinking, and analytical reasoning.</p>
